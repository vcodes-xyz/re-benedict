# re benedict

We will update the code https://github.com/vcodes-xyz/benedict soon. We have a few requests from you to start the construction of the new code;
   - Invite your friends to the server. (We need to be a total of 10,500 Members.) [Server](https://discord.gg/8ZBYQAS4Q9)
   - Star the Github code. (There must be a total of 150 stars.) [Repository](https://github.com/vcodes-xyz/benedict)
   - Invite your friends' bots. (There should be a total of 300 bots.)

What if the conditions don't come true?
   - I will not share the new code until the conditions are met because we do not charge you any fees. Just a few requests, you lose nothing to do it.


**We'll be posting new codes in this repository, so don't forget to star here!**

Best regards,
clqu.
